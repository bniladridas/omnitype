Please include the following information in your report:

- Any known mitigations
- Your contact information (optional)

### Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge your email within 48 hours

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as patch versions (e.g., 1.0.1, 1.0.2) for the latest minor version. We recommend always running the latest patch version of the software.

## Security Considerations
